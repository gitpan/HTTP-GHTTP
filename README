HTTP::GHTTP

This module is a simple interface to the Gnome project's libghttp.

libghttp is available either as an RPM as part of Gnome (for example
you will have it installed if you have Helix (Ximian) Gnome), or from
ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/libghttp/

It allows you to make very simple HTTP requests, without the weight
of something like LWP. This makes it very useful in situations where
memory and speed are at a premium, such as mod_perl.

The API is quite simple to use:

    use HTTP::GHTTP 'get';
    print get("http://foo.bar.com/");
    
or
    use HTTP::GHTTP:
    my $r = HTTP::GHTTP->new();
    $r->set_uri("http://foo.bar.com/");
    $r->process_request;
    print $r->get_body;

It has full support for proxy requests and authenticated requests.

There is also a command line script, g-request, which is similar in
operation to LWP's lwp-request. Run it without any parameters to get
usage information.

INSTALLATION

Short version:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  su
  make install

Watch the output - it will test to see if it can load libghttp, and
not continue if it cannot find it. If so you will have to specify
LIBS and INC on the perl Makefile.PL command line.
